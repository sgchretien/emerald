title: On the estimation of frequencies in a noisy signal
---


The estimation of the frequencies and coefficients of a sum of exponential functions corrupted by noise is a problem that has attracted great attention in the signal processing community.

The observed signal is of the form 

$$ y_t = \sum_{k=-K}^K \ c_k \exp (-2 i \pi f_k t)$$
